Creating a farm growth tracker mod for Project Zomboid requires adding a UI overlay or a menu that tracks your crops' growth stages, water needs, and time until harvest. Below is a detailed guide and implementation outline:

Features of the Farm Tracker
Crop Growth Overview:

Display all planted crops with their current growth stage (e.g., Seedling, Young Plant, Fully Grown).
Show how long (in days or hours) until the crop is harvestable.
Water Status:

Indicate whether the crop has sufficient water or needs more.
Show the exact water level (e.g., 0-100).
Disease Alert:

Highlight crops with diseases and provide tips for treatment.
Interactive List or Overlay:

Accessible via a hotkey or radial menu.
Optionally toggle an overlay that displays information above each crop in the game world.
